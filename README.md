1. Tell us who did what on the program.

Our group met 2-4 times a week to discuss where we were at in our progress and make sure all members were caught up with each other and knew how all stages of the project worked so far. We also went to office hours as a group on multiple occasions to ask questions about if certain parts of the project to ensure we were doing them correctly and gain a better understanding of things that we were struggling with. Overall it was a team effort that allowed us to complete this project effectively and in a timely manner.

2. Any other instructions.

- Run gnu make to produce our make4061.
- Use make4061 as you would the gnu make.
