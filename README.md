Andrew was our team leader for this project, he got us through the toughest parts of our project, Andrew also did the majority of the commenting on our functions and was a real team player. Our group met multiple times a week to discuss where we were at in our progress and made sure all members were caught up with each other and knew how all stages of the project worked so far. We also went to office hours as a group on multiple occasions to ask questions about if certain parts of the project to ensure we were doing them correctly and gain a better understanding of things that we were struggling with. Overall it was a team effort that allowed us to complete this project effectively and in a timely manner.
